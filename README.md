## Mechanics & Tech Stack

### Authentication System
- **Sign Up (`/signup`)**: Standard Google OAuth. Creates a new profile in Supabase.
- **Log In (`/login`)**: Verified Google OAuth. If no account exists, the session is rejected to prevent accidental duplicates.
- **Vendor Access (`/vendor/login`)**: **Strictly Restricted.** Vendors must have their email manually added to the Supabase database by an administrator. There is no public "Vendor Sign Up" flow to ensure only authorized shops can access the platform.

### Real-time Data Sync
- **Cart & Favorites**: Synced across devices instantly using Supabase Realtime.
- **Order Updates**: Vendors and customers receive live status updates (Paid → Preparing → Ready → Completed).

### Order Logic
- **Daily Pickup Codes**: Resets every 24 hours per shop (e.g., `0005`).
- **Reference Numbers**: Unique format for easy lookup: `[SHOP_CODE] [TIME] [DATE] [CODE]` (e.g., `RS 1230 050526 0005`).

## Admin Management

### Handling Shop Registrations
When a user submits a request via `/shop-registration`, it enters a `pending` state. Admins must manually approve these requests to create a shop and grant vendor access.

#### 1. Open/Close Registration
Run this in the Supabase SQL Editor:
- **Open**: `select private.set_shop_registration_enabled(true);`
- **Close**: `select private.set_shop_registration_enabled(false);`

#### 2. Approve a Shop
1. Find the `id` of the request in the `shop_registrations` table.
2. Run in SQL Editor: `select private.approve_shop_registration('ID_HERE');`
   - *This automatically creates the shop row and links the owner's Google ID.*

#### 3. Reject a Request
Run in SQL Editor: `select private.reject_shop_registration('ID_HERE');`

### Vendor Access Troubleshooting
If a vendor is approved but cannot log in:
1. Ensure `shops.owner_id` matches their `auth.users` UUID.
2. Verify `shops.is_approved` is `true`.
3. Check that the vendor is using the **exact same Google account** they used to apply.

## Admin Notes
- **New Vendors**: To add a vendor, manually add their email to the `auth.users` table in Supabase and associate it with a record in the `public.shops` table.
